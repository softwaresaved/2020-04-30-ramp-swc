<p>Also called <strong>revision control</strong> or <strong>source control</strong>. At their simplest these are tools which track <strong>changes</strong> to files.</p>

<p>We’ve <strong>all</strong> been in this situation before - <strong>multiple nearly-identical</strong> versions of the same file with no meaningful <strong>explanation</strong> of the differences are.</p>
<p>If we’re just dealing with Docs, some word processors let us deal with this a little better, like Microsoft Word (“Track Changes”) or Google Docs version history. BUT <strong>research isn’t just Words docs</strong>, it’s code and data and diagrams too.</p>
<p>Using <strong>version control</strong> means <strong>we don’t keep dozens of different versions</strong> of our files hanging about taking up <strong>space</strong>, and when we store a <strong>revision</strong>, we store an <strong>explanation</strong> of what changed. Explain how later.</p>
<h3 id="reproducibility">2. Reproducibility</h3>
<p>When you use <strong>version control</strong>, at any point in the future, you can retrieve the <strong>correct versions</strong> of your documents, scripts or code. So, for example, a year after <strong>publication</strong>, you can get hold of the <strong>precise combination</strong> of scripts and data that you used to assemble a paper.</p>
<p>Version control makes <strong>reproducibility</strong> simpler. Without using version control it’s very hard to say that your research is truly reproducible…</p>

<h3 id="to-aid-collaboration">3. To Aid Collaboration</h3>
<p>As well as maintaining a revison history, VC tools also help multiple authors <strong>collaborate</strong> on the <strong>same file</strong> or set of files.</p>
<p><strong>Professional software developers</strong> use VC work in large <strong>teams</strong> and to keep track of what they’ve done. They know who has changed what and when. And who to <strong>blame</strong> when things break!</p>
<p><strong>Every</strong> large software development project relies on VC, and most programmers use it for their small jobs as well.</p>
<p><strong>VC not just for software</strong>: papers, small data sets - anything that changes over time, or needs to be shared <strong>can</strong>, and <strong>probably should</strong> be stored in a version control system.</p>
<p>We’ll look at both the backup and collaboration scenarios, but first it’s useful to understand what going on <strong>under the hood</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Version control systems start by storing the base version</strong> of the file that you save and then <strong>store just the changes</strong> you made at each step on the way. You can think of it as a tape: if you rewind the tape and <strong>start</strong> at the base document, then you can <strong>play back</strong> each change and end up with your latest version.</p>

</div>
<p>Once you think of <strong>changes as separate from the document</strong> itself, you can then think about “playing back” different sets of changes onto the base document and getting different versions of the document. For example, <strong>two users can make independent sets of changes</strong> based on the same document.</p>

<p>If there aren’t conflicts, you can even try to play two sets of changes onto the same base document. A process call <strong>merging</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>These are the most popular current Version Control systems</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Subversion</strong> has been around since about 2000, it was developed to replace the venerable <strong>Concurrent Versioning System (CVS)</strong>. It introduced such revolutionary concepts as the ability <strong>rename</strong> files whilst retaining their version history.</p>
<p>With <strong>Subversion</strong> a <strong>single master copy</strong> of the repository (the files under version control) exists - the only place where all revision history is kept. If you’re working as <strong>team</strong> you need to connect to the <strong>central server</strong> to store a revision</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Mercurial</strong> and <strong>Git</strong> are newer and work a little differently - they are <strong>Distributed</strong> Version control systems - each developer in a team has their <strong>own full copy</strong> of the repository which are then synchronised. You can use Git without a network connection and there’s no single point of failuire.</p>
<p>Both <strong>Mercurial</strong> and <strong>Git</strong> arose from the need to find a new Version Control System for the Linux Kernel, after BitKeeper became non-free in 2005.</p>
<p><strong>Git</strong> was written by Linus Torvalds <strong>(who he?)</strong> (maintainer of the Linux kernel), to scratch his own itch, so if you think it’s idiosyncractic in places, you know who to blame.</p>
<hr />
<p>Git <strong>now most widely used</strong> and has found wider prominence partly through the rise of <strong>GitHub</strong> - a web based Git <strong>repository hosting</strong> service which simplifies <strong>collaboration</strong>.</p>
<p>GitHub also provide project management bells and whistles like <strong>bug tracking</strong>, <strong>task management</strong>.</p>
<p>You don’t <strong>need</strong> to use GitHub to employ Git, but we will use it today to demonstrate the use of remote repositories.</p>
