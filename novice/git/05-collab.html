<p>So far, we’ve seen how Version control can help us <strong>track the changes</strong> we make to our files, and to <strong>revisit</strong> any point in their history.</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/slides/version-control-with-git-slides%20-%2018.jpg" alt="Git Workflow - Local Repo" />
  <p class="caption">Git Workflow - Local Repo</p>
</div>
<p>(there are a few extra commands we haven’t covered today for you to look at).</p>
<p>
  But, the files are still only stored on our own computers. 
  Version control really comes into its own when we put them online, and start to <strong>collaborate</strong> with other people.
</p>

<h3 id="the-missing-link">The missing link</h3>
<p>We already have most of the machinery we need to do this; the only thing missing is to copy changes from one repository to another.</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/slides/version-control-with-git-slides%20-%2019.jpg" alt="Collaboration" />
  <p class="caption">Collaboration</p>
</div>
<p>Systems like Git allow us to <strong>synchronise</strong> work between any two repositories.</p>
<p>In practice, though, it’s easiest to use one copy as a <strong>central hub</strong>, and to keep it on the web rather than on someone’s laptop.</p>
<p>Many programmers use hosting services like <strong>GitHub</strong> or <strong>BitBucket</strong> to hold those master copies. In this example, we'll use <strong>GitHub</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="exploring-the-collaborative-process">Exploring the collaborative process</h3>
<p>But first let’s explore the collaborative process.</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/slides/version-control-with-git-slides%20-%2020.jpg" alt="Collaboration" /> 
  <p class="caption">Collaboration</p>
</div>
<p>
  So far we have been working in isolation. We’re going to use <strong>GitHub</strong> to set up a remote repository, 
  so we can share our work and start <strong>“collaborating”</strong> with others.
</p>

<h3 id="developer-a---to-github">To GitHub!</h3>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/slides/version-control-with-git-slides%20-%2021.jpg" alt="Remote Repositories #1" /> <!-- CHANGE THIS -->
  <p class="caption">Remote Repositories #1</p>
</div>
<p>
  Let’s start by sharing the changes we’ve made to our current project with the world.
  <strong>Log in to GitHub</strong>, then click on the icon in the top right corner to create a <strong>new repository</strong> called <code>climate-analysis</code>:
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/github-create-repo-01.png" alt="Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 1)" />
  <p class="caption">Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 1)</p>
</div>
<p>
  <strong>Name your repository</strong> “climate-analysis”. 
  You can optionally give it a friendly <strong>description</strong> and prove a <strong>README.md</strong> which is rendered on the front page of the web interface.
</p>
<p>
  GitHub will host <strong>Publicly</strong> accessible repositories <strong>free</strong> of charge, but makes a charge for Private ones. 
  However, researchers can apply for a 
  <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/applying-for-an-educator-or-researcher-discount">free GitHub Pro upgrade</a>
  via GitHub Education, which will allow you free unlimited private repositories.
  <strong>BitBucket</strong> offers free private repositories for teams of up to 5.
</p>
<p>
  You need to be sure that you <strong>really want to make your code publicly accessible</strong>, 
  think about <strong>licensing</strong>, and that you’re not <strong>breaching the terms of any license</strong> of shared code by making it publicly available.
</p>
<p>and then click <strong>“Create Repository”</strong>:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/github-create-repo-02.png" alt="Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 2)" />
<p class="caption">Creating a Repository on GitHub (Step 2)</p>
</div>
<h3 id="connecting-the-remote-repository">Connecting the remote repository</h3>
<p>Our <strong>local</strong> repository still contains our earlier work on <code>climate-analysis.py</code> and <code>temp_conversion.py</code>, but the <strong>remote</strong> repository on GitHub doesn’t contain any files yet:</p>
<p>The next step is to <strong>connect</strong> the two repositories.</p>
<p>We do this by making the GitHub repository a <strong>remote</strong> for the local repository. A <strong>remote</strong> is a repository conected to another in such way that both can be kept <strong>in sync</strong> exchanging commits.</p>
<p>The home page of the repository on GitHub includes the string we need to identify it:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/github-find-repo-string.png" alt="Where to Find Repository URL on GitHub" />
<p class="caption">Where to Find Repository URL on GitHub</p>
</div>
<p>Copy that URL from the browser, go back to your local repository, and run this command <strong>using your repository name</strong> not mine:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">git</span> remote add origin https://github.com/js-robinson/climate-analysis.git</code></pre></div>
<p>The name <code>origin</code> is a <strong>local nickname</strong> for your <strong>remote repository</strong>: we <strong>could</strong> use something else if we wanted to, but <code>origin</code> is <strong>conventional</strong>, and will come in useful later.</p>
<p>The only difference should be your username instead of <code>js-robinson</code>.</p>
<p>We can check that the command has worked by running <code>git remote --verbose</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash">
  <code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">git</span> remote --verbose</code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output"><code>origin  https://github.com/js-robinson/climate-analysis.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/js-robinson/climate-analysis.git (push)</code></pre>

<h3 id="push-commits-from-local-to-remote">Push commits from local to remote</h3>
<p>Once the remote is set up, we can <strong>push</strong> the changes from our local repository to the repository on GitHub:</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
  <pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">git</span> push origin master</code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output">
  <code>Counting objects: 10, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
Writing objects: 100% (10/10), 1.47 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 10 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/js-robinson/climate-analysis.git
 * [new branch]      master -&gt; master</code>
</pre>
<p>The push command takes two arguments, the <strong>remote name</strong> (‘origin’) and a <strong>branch name</strong> (‘master’).</p>
<p>We'll get to <strong>branches</strong> in a moment!</p>
<p>
  So, now, our local and remote repositories are now <strong>in sync</strong>! 
  You can check in your browser that the files have reached your GitHub repository.
</p>

<!-- NEW FROM HERE ONWARDS -->
<h3 id="introducing-branches">Introducing branches</h3>
<p>
  Now we've shared our code with the world, and other people can download a copy of it- 
  just like you downloaded a copy of the repository these lessons are in.
</p>
<p>
  However, what happens if you want to keep working on it, adding new features to the code? 
</p>
<p>
  At the moment, there's only one version of the code available online. 
  If keep making changes and pushing them to <strong>GitHub</strong>, 
  then anyone who downloads from there will get all of our work in progress- 
  whether or not it's ready to use!
</p>
<p>
  Equally, we can't wait until we've finished all our work before <strong>pushing</strong> it to GitHub either.
  We could lose weeks or months of work if our computer breaks!
</p>
<p>
  We can avoid this by using the <strong>branches</strong> we mentioned earlier.
</p>
<p>
  A <strong>branch</strong> is a <strong>different version</strong> of the files in your repository,
  that can contain its own set of <strong>commits</strong>. 
  We can create a new branch, make changes to the code that we commit to the branch,
  and when we're happy with those changes, <strong>merge</strong> them back to the main (‘master’) branch.
  Branches are commonly used as part of a <strong>feature-branch workflow</strong>:
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/git-feature-branch.svg" alt="Feature-branch workflow" />
  <p class="caption">Feature-branch workflow</p>
</div>
<p>
  In this workflow, we have a main (‘master’) branch which is the version of our code that's test and reliable,
  and want to share- for example, the version of the code we used in a paper.
</p>
<p>
  Then, we have a development (‘dev’) branch that we use for work-in-progress code.
  As we work on adding new features to the code, we commit the changes to our development branch.
</p>
<p>
  (We'll talk about feature branches later!)
</p>

<h3 id="creating-branches">Creating branches</h3>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/slides/branches-1.jpg" alt="Creating branches" />
  <p class="caption">Creating branches</p>
</div>
<p>
  Let's <strong>create a development branch</strong> to work on:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
  <pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">git</span> branch dev</code></pre>
</div>
<p>
  This command doesn't give any output, but if we run <code>git branch</code> again, 
  without giving it a new branch name, we can see the list of branches we have- 
  including the new one we just made.
</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
  <pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">git</span> branch</code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output">
  <code>  dev
  * master</code>
</pre>
<p>
  So how do we <strong>switch</strong> to this new branch? We use <code>git checkout</code> again,
  but this time with the name of the branch instead of the name of a file:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
  <pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">git</span> checkout dev</code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output"><code>Switched to branch 'dev'</code></pre>

<!-- Add warning about uncomitted changes -->

<h3 id="developer-b---cloning-the-remote-repository">Committing to branches</h3>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/slides/branches-2.jpg" alt="Comitting to branches" />
  <p class="caption">Committing to branches</p>
</div>
<p>
  Now we've created a ‘dev’ branch, we can start working on it without affecting our ‘master’ branch.
</p>
<p>
  Lets expand our library of climate analysis functions by adding a <strong>new file</strong>:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
  <pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">nano</span> rainfall_conversion.py
$ <span class="fu">cat</span> rainfall_conversion.py</code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output"><code>&quot;&quot;&quot;A library to perform rainfall unit conversions&quot;&quot;&quot;

def inches_to_mm(inches):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Convert inches to milimetres.

    Arguments:
    inches -- the rainfall inches
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    mm = inches * 25.4
    return mm</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode">
  <pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">git</span> add rainfall_conversion.py
$ <span class="fu">git</span> commit -m <span class="st">&quot;Add rainfall module&quot;</span></code></pre>
</div>
<pre class="output"><code>[dev 29f4a55] Add rainfall module
 1 file changed, 10 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 rainfall_conversion.py</code></pre>

<p>
  You might have noticed a change already. 
  The commit message now reminds us we're committing to the <strong>‘dev’ branch</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Now, if we check the history, we can see this commit was added:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode">
  <pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">git</span> log</code></pre>

    Initial commit of climate analysis code
  
</code></pre>

<p>
  We can see the new commit to the dev branch in the <strong>log</strong>.
  Helpfully, the history also shows the point at which our new ‘dev’ branch broke away from the ‘master’ branch.
</p>
<p>
  Let's switch back to the ‘master’ branch and look at the directory again:
</p>

<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">git</span> checkout master</code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>Switched to branch 'master'</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">ls</span></code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>climate_analysis.py  temp_conversion.py</code></pre>

<p>
  We can see that the <code>rainfall_conversion.py</code> file we created on the ‘dev’ branch has disappeared.
  However, if you check out ‘dev’ again, it'll reappear:
</p>
 
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">git</span> checkout dev</code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>Switched to branch 'dev'</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">ls</span></code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>climate_analysis.py  rainfall_conversion.py  temp_conversion.py</code></pre>

<!-- ONGOING WORK -->
<h3 id="pushing-branches">Pushing & updating branches</h3>
<p>
  Now we have a commit to our ‘dev’ branch, how do we get the changes from it into our ‘master’ branch?
  There's a couple of ways of doing this, but we're going to do it using a <strong>pull request on GitHub</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  First, we'll push the contents of the ‘dev’ branch to GitHub the same way as we pushed the ‘master’ branch:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">git</span> push origin dev</code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>Counting objects: 3, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.

remote:

 * [new branch]      dev -> dev</code></pre>
<!-- CALLOUT FOR GIT PUSH CONFIG -->
<p>
  Now our ‘dev’ branch is on GitHub! Let's go and check it out. 
  Just above the list of files on the left-hand side is a dropdown labelled 'branches'. 
  Select 'dev', and you should see the list of files change:
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/github-branches.png" alt="GitHub branches" />
  <p class="caption">GitHub branches</p>
</div>
<p>
  At the top of the list of files, a notification tells you that this branch has more commits in it than the ‘master’ branch.
  If we want to see what the difference is, and <strong>merge the changes</strong> from ‘dev’ to ‘master’, we need to make a <strong>pull request</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Click on the <strong>Pull request</strong> button, and it should take you to a new screen:
</p>

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/github-branches-pull.png" alt="GitHub pull request" />
  <p class="caption">GitHub pull request</p>
</div>
<p>
  A <strong>pull request</strong> is a formal way to request to merge the changes from one branch into another, 
  providing a message letting people know what your changes do.
  GitHub provides you with a range of tools to help manage pull requests.
</p>
<p>
  If you're part of a team, you can suggest <strong>reviewers</strong> for your code, 
  just as you'd recommend reviewers for a paper. Getting extra eyes on your code can help spot any bugs or mistakes early on.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, you can <strong>assign</strong> the pull request to someone.
  They'll be notified that they've been assigned. 
  If your code can't be automatically merged, you can request an RSE or someone else on the project to help you with it.
</p>
<p>
  Below this section of the <strong>pull request</strong>, you can see a list of changes this pull request would make. 
  These is useful when reviewing code:
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/github-branches-pull-2.png" alt="GitHub pull request #2" />
  <p class="caption">GitHub pull request #2</p>
</div>
<p>
  In this case, we can see one new file has been created.
</p>
<p>
  Now, let's click <strong>Create pull request</strong>:
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/github-branches-pull-3.png" alt="GitHub pull request #3" />
  <p class="caption">GitHub pull request #3</p>
</div>
<p>
  Fortunately, this commit can be <strong>automatically merged.</strong>
  You can merge branches that have different commits in them, 
  for example if you made another commit directly to ‘master’ before trying to merge in ‘dev’.
  However, if both branches edit the same lines of the same file(s) then there may be a <strong>conflict</strong> that prevents automatic merging.
</p>
<p>
  It is possible to <strong>resolve merge conflicts</strong> on the command-line git, but we won't cover it today.
  Your project's RSE will be able to help you with any pull requests that raise conflicts.
</p>
<p>
  Now we can click <strong>Merge pull request</strong>, and then add a commit message and click <strong>Confirm merge</strong> to update ‘master’!
</p>
<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/github-branches-pull-4.png" alt="GitHub pull request #4" />
  <p class="caption">GitHub pull request #4</p>
</div>
<p>
  Now we've updated the ‘master’ branch with our new work from the ‘dev’ branch! All we need to do is to update our <strong>local version</strong>.
  Let's go back to the command line and check out the master branch, then <strong>pull our changes</strong> from GitHub to our computer:
</p>

<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">git</span> checkout master</code></pre></div>
<pre class="output"><code>Switched to branch 'master'</code></pre>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="fu">git</span> pull origin master</code></pre></div>
